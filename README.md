⚠️ Disclaimer
This project was made long ago while I was practicing
DOM manipulation and working with APIs.
It may not follow best practices as it was mainly for learning purposes.
Also do note that this webapp was first built in Electron.js, that is why it may not appear as amusing in the web ;P

# 🌦 ThunderPHP - Weather App
##### **Purpose: Getting to know REST-API**

**ThunderPHP** is a clone of the *Weathron* weather app (built with Electron.js), now reimagined with PHP. It allows users to search for any city, country, or region and get the current day's weather. ThunderPHP provides a unique double-fetching approach: it first fetches weather data through a REST API in PHP, and then the data is fetched again on the JavaScript side for dynamic display. This seamless integration between PHP and JavaScript, along with a weather API, ensures a smooth and user-friendly interface for displaying real-time weather information.
